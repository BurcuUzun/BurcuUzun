* # Hi, I'm Burcu! 👋

### 🏛️ Computer Engineering Student @ Middle East Technical University (METU)

I am a software engineer focused on **Systems Programming** and **Algorithmic Optimization**. I bridge the gap between low-level memory management (C) and high-level data processing (Python).

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Languages:** C (Pointers, Memory Allocation), Python (NumPy, Recursion), MATLAB.
* **Focus Areas:** Algorithm Design, Data Structures, System Simulations, Linux/Shell.


### 📂 Featured Work
* **[Custom Command Shell (C)](https://github.com/BurcuUzun/custom-command-interpreter-c):** A memory-safe CLI that executes system commands using fork/exec patterns.
* **[3D Matrix Normalizer (C)](https://github.com/BurcuUzun/3d-matrix-normalizer-c):** A high-performance statistical tool for normalizing large 3D datasets.
* **[Recursive Tiling Solver (Python)](https://github.com/BurcuUzun/recursive-tiling-solver-python):** A backtracking algorithm optimized to solve complex 2D geometry constraints.
